### Goal

- Originally I wanted to predict stock prices.  After educating myself, I realized its more important to be able to predict weither or not the stock would go up or down for a specific day.  
- I also learned not to normalize (aka min max scaler) because there is no max price when it comes to stocks.  At least that is the way I understood what I read.  I will check back and provide a more solid explanation in the near future.
